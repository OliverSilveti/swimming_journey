# swimming_journey

Overview

This project documents my personal swimming journey, analyzed and visualized using AI tools and data science techniques inside a Jupyter Notebook.
It explores how machine learning and data visualization can help track progress, identify performance patterns, and suggest areas for improvement.

📘 What’s Inside

The repository contains a single Jupyter Notebook:

swimming_journey.ipynb – the main notebook where I:

Log and visualize swimming data (distance, time, pace, heart rate, etc.)

Explore performance trends using Python and AI libraries

Generate insights with basic predictive or statistical models

Reflect on how AI can enhance personal training and motivation

🧠 Key Features

Data cleaning and transformation using pandas

Visualization with matplotlib and seaborn

Simple AI/ML insights using scikit-learn

Narrative and reflections on training progress

🌊 Reflections

This notebook represents how AI can support personal growth—not just competitive performance.
By analyzing swim sessions with data-driven methods, I gained insights into stamina, pace, and recovery that helped improve my overall technique.
